Modules
=======

AviScript allows organizing code into _modules_.

A module holds a collection of [functions](../functions/functions.md), [constants](../variables/constants.md) and sub-modules.

It may encapsulates a AviScript script together with the [functions](../functions/functions.md) and
[constants](../variables/constants.md) defined by that script.

Other scripts can then load this module and use the [functions](../functions/functions.md) and
[constants](../variables/constants.md) exported as if they were defined inside the same script.
