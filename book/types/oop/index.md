Oriented Object Programming (OOP)
==========

Special Support for OOP
------------------------

Object maps can be used to simulate object-oriented programming (OOP) by storing data as properties
and methods as properties holding [function pointers](../fn-ptr.md).

If an object map's property holds a [function pointer](../fn-ptr.md), the property can simply be called
like a normal method in method-call syntax.

This is a _short-hand_ to avoid the more verbose syntax of using the `call` function keyword.

When a property holding a [function pointer](../fn-ptr.md) or a [closure](../fn-closure.md) is called like
a method, it is replaced as a method call on the object map itself.

```rust
let obj = #{
                data: 40,
                action: || this.data += x    // 'action' holds a closure
           };

obj.action(2);                               // calls the function pointer with 'this' bound to 'obj'

obj.call(obj.action, 2);                     // <- the above de-sugars to this

obj.data == 42;

// To achieve the above with normal function pointer call will fail.

fn do_action(map, x) { map.data += x; }      // 'map' is a copy

obj.action = do_action;                      // <- de-sugars to 'Fn("do_action")'

obj.action.call(obj, 2);                     // a copy of 'obj' is passed by value

obj.data == 42;                              // 'obj.data' is not changed
```
